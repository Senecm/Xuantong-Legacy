	click on mod tools and create a mod
2.Enter a name for the mod, 
	and the version which it is designed for, 
	then create a directory name and assign tags (you can close the launcher now)

Creating a focus tree:

1.Navigate to file,
	[
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron IV\common\national_focus
	]
2.Create the relevent folders in your mod file,
	create a folder 'common'
	in common create a folder called 'national_focus'

3.COPY a 'australia.txt' file and paste it into your mod file,
	rename it to your relevent country you are modding

4.Go back into the main mod folder, 
	create a folder called 'interface'
	from:
	[	
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron IV\interface
	]
	copy files 'goals' and 'goals_shine'

5.Next create a folder called gfx,
	inside that folder create a folder called 'interface'
	inside interface create a folder called 'goals'
	from:
	[
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron IV\gfx\interface\goals
	]
	copy a file over to your mod
	change the name to something like '{COUNTRY}_focus_conquer'
	go to the 'interface' folder in your mod folder
	open the goals file and copy a sprite type entry
	paste it above the commented line
	on the 'texturefile' copy the name of the file in the 'goals' folder in your mod file0

	open the 'goals_shine' file
	then copy a sprite type and paste it above the first sprite type
	then change the name to whatever was in the 'goals' file make sure its followed by '_shine'
	under the 'texturefile' line do as was done with the goals file, but change it at every interval of the copied sprite

	then change the 'icon = ' line in the 'national_focus' file
	
	

6.Next create a folder called localisation,
	from:
	[
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron IV\localisation
	]
	copy a file that has '_l_english' in it and paste it in your mod file
	rename it to '{COUNTRY}_focus_l_english' (where country is the country your modding)
	Open the file and delete everythin except 'l_english:'

7.Open the national_focus folder in your mod folder,
	click after the semi colon located after 'continuious focus position'
	then, hold shift and click just before the last 'focus = {' in the file
	press backspace (delete everything selected)

	change the 'id' to 'id = {COUNTRY}_focus'
	delete the 'has_dlc' line
	delete the commented 'modifer' paragraph
	change the 'tag' line to the tag of your country e.g 'tag = CHI' for china
	adjust the 'continuous_focus_position' (go into debug mode)
	to adjust, change the x and the y (when relative position id)
	
	7.1 Rearranging the focus syntax (some is optional maked with (o)),
	under 'focus = {'
		change the 'id' to the name of the focus you want it to be e.g 'id = scotty_from_marketing'
		move the prerequisites line under the 'y =' line with a space(o)
		being the first focus, you can remove the 'relative_position_id' and the 'prerequisites'
		move the 'ai_will_do' block to the bottom (o)

	open the localisation file
	type the id of the focus e.g 'id = scotty_from_marketing'

8.Open the localisation folder you made in your mod file,
	copy the 'id' of on of the focuses you made in the national_focus file and paste it in the localisation file
	follow it up with a semi colon and a zero e.g scotty_from_marketing:0
	then type quotation marks and within them type what you want the focus to show up as
	e.g scotty_from_marketting:0 "Scotty From Marketting"
	to add a description, make a new line 
	paste the 'id' of the focus and add '_desc' after it 
	then add the semi colon, zero and quotation amrks
	e.g scotty_from_marketting_desc:0 "Scotty is pretty cool, and from  marketing!"

other Syntax:
	mutually_exclusive = { focus = {NAME_OF_FOCUS} }
